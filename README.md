This project explores recent discoveries in reinforcement learning and applies them to two-player zero-sum games such as tic-tac-toe and connect 4. A paradigm I stuck to was only allowing the agent to learn through self-play, allowing the techniques to be applied to unsolved games where the optimal strategy is not known. The hyperparameter space is explored and optimization techniques are applied.
