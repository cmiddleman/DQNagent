galvanize capstone 2

Proposals:
1: Create a model that leanrns how to play super tic tac toe (recursive tic tac toe) through self play. I did some some work previously related to this  (for just regular tic tac toe), repo at https://github.com/cmiddleman/tictactoe

2: Get a computer vision model to figure out captchas. Test s to get past captchas from real sites like amazon.com. 
    Dataset (potentially use others) data: https://www.kaggle.com/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images
    
3: Classify images of balls. https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/balls-image-classification
